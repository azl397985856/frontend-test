# Frontend Test
This repo contains almost everything about frontend  testing, it's usefull especially when you'r building large apps.

It mainly cover there four parts:

* What is test

* Why to test

* Ways to test

* Visual test

> this topic only covers the test itself, and the framework parts such as mocha and jest are on their way.
## What the hell is test
Test is `code` to ensure your code works `as expected`.

To `ensure`, we may need to assert which is the core of testing.

To be `as excepected`, you may need to consider every part about your program, nobody can help you,
there is no silver bullet. But high coverage always produce hight quality code.

> alway doesn't mean inevitable
## Why to test

### To deploy your app with no fear
without testing, adding new feature or fixing bug is tough.

It's hard to guarantee the code added doesn't effect the old code.
(fix a bug, produce two or more bugs)

But things are diffrent if your code base is well tested.
sure, you can deploy your app without fear.

>  it doesnâ€™t really matter how you do your tests, as long as you write enough tests that make you feel confident that you can deploy your version to production.          --Gil Tayar
