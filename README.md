## What the hell is test
Test is `code` to ensure your code works `as expected`.

To `ensure`, we may need to assert which is the core of testing.

To be `as excepected`, you may need to consider every part about your program, nobody can hekp you,
there is no silver bullet. But high coverage always produce hight quality code.
